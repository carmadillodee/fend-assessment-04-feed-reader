## Udacity RSS Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

Original Source: Udacity FEND Nanodegree
Jasmine Feedtester Setup: Carmen D
With thanks to Matthew Cranford's tutorial for in-depth code explanations for the original app used within the Initial Functions section of the suite: https://matthewcranford.com/feed-reader-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code/

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Instructions for running SpecRunner

1. Navigate to index.html in your file explorer
2. Open the selected file in your preferred browser. (If this is not your default option, right-click and click 'Open With' to select your browser)
3. Upon loading, tests will initiate. Upon completion, these results will display at    the bottom of the page.

## Trouble-Shooting
- If changes are being implemented to the code and are causing tests to fail, code for   logging results at crucial parts can be found greyed out in feedreader.js to help you insolate the source of the issue by logging key values.
- Check to make sure you have a working internet connection
